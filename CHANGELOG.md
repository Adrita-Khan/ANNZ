# Changelog

## Master version

- **Added the script, `annz_rndReg_weights.py`:** This shows how one may derive the weights based on the KNN method (using `useWgtKNN`), and/or the `inTrainFlag` quality-flag, without training/evaluating any MLMs.

## ANNZ 2.0.5 (17/6/2015)

- Fixed bug in `CatFormat::addWgtKNNtoTree()`, where the weight expression for the KNN trees did not include the `ANNZ_KNN_w` weight in cases of `glob.annz["addInTrainFlag"] = True`.

- Modified the condition on the MLM error estimator which is propagated to PDFs in randomized regression. Previously if an error was undefined, indicating a problem, the code would stop. Now the MLM is ignored and the code continues. The change is needed as sometimes there is a valid reason for the error to be undefined.

- Other minor modifications.

## ANNZ 2.0.4 (19/3/2015)

- **Modified the function, `CatFormat::addWgtKNNtoTree()`, and added `CatFormat::asciiToFullTree_wgtKNN()`:** The purpose of the new features is to add an output variable, denoted as `inTrainFlag` to the output of evaluation. The new output indicates if the corresponding object is "compatible" with other objects from the training dataset. The compatibility is estimated by comparing the density of objects in the training dataset in the vicinity of the evaluated object. If the evaluated object belongs to an area of parameter-space which is not represented in the training dataset, we will get `inTrainFlag = 0`. In this case, the output of the training is probably unreliable.

- Other minor modifications.

## ANNZ 2.0.3 (25/2/2015)

- **Added *MultiClass* support to binned classification:** The new option is controlled by setting the `doMultiCls` flag. In this mode, multiple background samples can be trained simultaneously against the signal. In the context of binned classification, this means that each classification bin acts as an independent sample during the training.

- **Added the function, `ANNZ::deriveHisClsPrb()`:** Modified binned classification, such that all classification probabilities are calculated by hand, instead of using the `CreateMVAPdfs` option of `TMVA::Factory`. By default, the new calculation takes into account the relative size of the signal in each classification bin, compared to the number of objects in the entire training sample. The latter feature may be turned off, by setting:
  ```python
  glob.annz["useBinClsPrior"] = False
  ```

- Added `ANNZ_PDF_max`, the most likely value of a PDF (the peak of the PDF), to the outputs of regression.

- Fixed compatibility issues with ROOT v6.02.

- Fixed bug in `VarMaps::storeTreeToAscii()`, where variables of type `Long64_t` were treated as `Bool_t` by mistake, causing a crash.

- Other minor modifications.

## ANNZ 2.0.2 (10/2/2015)

Fixed bug in VarMaps::storeTreeToAscii(), where variables of type `Long64_t` were treated as `Bool_t` by mistake, causing a crash.

## ANNZ 2.0.1 (10/2/2015)

The following changes were made:

- **Modified the way in which the KNN error estimator works:**
In the previous version, the errors were generated by looping for each object over the *n* near-neighbors in the training dataset. For a given object, this was for all neighbors for each of the MLMs.
In the revised version, MLM response values for the entire training dataset are estimated once; this is done before the loop on the objects begins, with the results stored in a dedicated tree (see `ANNZ::createTreeErrKNN()`). This tree is then read-in during the loop over the  objects for which the errors are generated. In this implementation, the KNN neighbor search is done once for all MLMs, and the errors are estimated simultaneously for all. This prevents both the unnecessary repeated calculations of MLM outputs, and the redundant searches for the *n* near-neighbors for the same object.

- **Name of evaluation subdirectory:**
Added the variable `evalDirPostfix`, which allows to modify the name of the evaluation subdirectory. Different input files can now be evaluated simultaneously, without overwriting previous results. The example scripts have been modified accordingly.

- Various small modifications.

## ANNZ 2.0.0 (26/1/2015)

First version (v2.0.0) of the new implementation of the machine learning code, ANNz.
