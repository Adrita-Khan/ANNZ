## ANNZ 2.0.2 (10/2/2015)

Fixed bug in VarMaps::storeTreeToAscii(), where variables of type `Long64_t` were treated as `Bool_t` by mistake, causing a crash.

## ANNZ 2.0.1 (10/2/2015)

The following changes were made:

- **Modified the way in which the KNN error estimator works:**
In the previous version, the errors were generated by looping for each object over the *n* near-neighbors in the training dataset. For a given object, this was for all neighbors for each of the MLMs.
In the revised version, MLM response values for the entire training dataset are estimated once; this is done before the loop on the objects begins, with the results stored in a dedicated tree (see `ANNZ::createTreeErrKNN()`). This tree is then read-in during the loop over the  objects for which the errors are generated. In this implementation, the KNN neighbor search is done once for all MLMs, and the errors are estimated simultaneously for all. This prevents both the unnecessary repeated calculations of MLM outputs, and the redundant searches for the *n* near-neighbors for the same object.

- **Name of evaluation subdirectory:**
Added the variable `evalDirPostfix`, which allows to modify the name of the evaluation subdirectory. Different input files can now be evaluated simultaneously, without overwriting previous results. The example scripts have been modified accordingly.

- Various small modifications.

## ANNZ 2.0.0 (26/1/2015)

First version (v2.0.0) of the new implementation of the machine learning code, ANNz.
